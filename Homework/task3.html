    <h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>

    <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
    <div class="formula"><span>ax + b = 0</span></div>
    <p>
      where <span class="variable">a</span> and
      <span class="variable">b</span> are real numbers and
      <span class="variable">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes
      called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear
      equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may
      not be an <span class="variable">x</span> so donâ€™t get too locked into
      always seeing an <span class="variable">x</span> there.
    </p>
    <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>
    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
    <div class="formula"><span>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</span></div>
    <p>
      where <span class="variable">a</span>, <span class="variable">b</span>,
      <span class="variable">c</span> are known values and
      <span class="variable">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know
      it yet). Also, a can't be 0.
    </p>
    <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="variable">&pi;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span
        class="variable"
        >r</span
      >) squared:
    </p>
    <div class="formula"><span>A = &pi; &times; r^2</span></div>
    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="variable">D</span>):</p>
    <div class="formula"><span>A = (&pi; / 4) &times; D^2</span></div>
    <p>
      or, when you know the circumference (<span class="variable">C</span>):
    </p>
    <div class="formula"><span>A = C^2 / 4 &times; &pi;</span></div>
    <h3>Intersection</h3>
    <p>
      The intersection of two sets <span class="variable">A</span> and
      <span class="variable">B</span>, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all
      objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
      <span>A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      That is, <span class="variable">x</span> is an element of the intersection
      A &cap; B if and only if <span class="variable">x</span> is both an
      element of <span class="variable">A</span> and an element of
      <span class="variable">B</span>.
