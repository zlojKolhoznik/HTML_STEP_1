    <h1>Vehicle</h1>

    <p>
      A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup>[1]</sup>) is a machine that
      transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor
      vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains,
      trams), watercraft (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled
      vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.<sup>[2]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and
      drive forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO
      3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for
      road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup>[3]</sup>
